# Holiday Eggs

## Jason
If you type `plant` in the Kringle Kiosk the plant Jason is displayed.
Jason is also located on the scaffold.

## Santa Portait
In the [Santa Portait](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2020/blob/master/Additional/santa_portrait.jpg) in the Entry hall are [hidden characters](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2020/blob/master/Additional/santa_portrait_letters.jpg) for the phrase "NOW I SHALL BE OUT OF SIGHT".

## Nail
There is a nail on the scaffold left to the entrance of the castle. This nail provides a link to a [channel](https://www.twitch.tv/banjocrashland) where someone talks about applying hacking skills to get a new job.
