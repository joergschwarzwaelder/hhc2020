# Objective 1: Uncover Santa's Gift List

A [photo of a desk](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2020/blob/master/Objective-1/billboard.png) was provided  along with the hint, that the tool [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) could be used to untwirl.

It was possible to perform the untwirl at least in way that is was visible that Santa plan to get a Proxmark for Josh Wright.
