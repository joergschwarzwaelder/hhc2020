# Objective 4: Operate the Santavator
Location: Santavator

## Approach 1
To operate the Santavator some tools are required:

 - Santavator Key
 - three coloured Bulbs
 - a Hex Nut
 - a Rubber Ball

There are also other items lying on the floor, but these do not seem to be required as the below picture indicates.

## Approach 2
It is possible to tweak the Santavator HTML code to reach every single floor, as long as the green power supply is established, which is an easy task.

Just replace in the highlighted line the value of `data-floor` with your destination floor (1, 1.5, 2, 3, r) and you can get there by pressing the "1" button. This even bypasses the Santa fingerprint sensor.
