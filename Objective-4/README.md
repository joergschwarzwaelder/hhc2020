# Objective 4: Operate the Santavator
Location: Santavator

## Approach 1
To operate the Santavator some tools are required:

 - Santavator Key
 - three coloured Bulbs
 - a Hex Nut
 - a Rubber Ball

There are also other items lying on the floor, but these do not seem to be required as the below picture indicates.

## Approach 2
It is possible to tweak the Santavator HTML code to reach every single floor.

Just replace in the highlighted line the value of `data-floor` with your destination floor (1, 1.5, 2, 3, R) and you can get there by pressing the "1" button. This even bypasses the Santa fingerprint sensor.
