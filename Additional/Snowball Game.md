# Snowball Game
The objective of the Snowball game is to win the game on difficulty level "impossible".
Basically only "easy" and "impossible" were used to complete this objective.

On "easy" the user is able to provide a seed value which is used to determine the board layout. Providing the same seed value does always leads to the same board layout.
On "impossible" it is not possible to provide this seed value. In the HTML comments are the 624 random values, which were generated prior to create the seed for the current game.
